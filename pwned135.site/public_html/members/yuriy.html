  <h1> Yuriy Efremov </h1>
  	<h4> My official name is Iurii Iuzifovich but I typically go by this one. I am a 4th year Computer Science major student at UC San Diego. My interests are quite versatile. I workout, play games, and often do unrelated to school coding projects, the latest one involving a REST api hosted on google's app engine. I also taught myself Unity game engine, have a number of experimental projects involving shaders and physics, also developed and exported a full game called Neon Lanes which is on my github.
