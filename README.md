# browser_data_db_api

A node.js server that also hosts a website with apache and an sql database. When users visits the website their browsing data is automatically deployed through rest api to the database, which they are later able to view on the same website through zingchart. Rerunning the project is not easily accessable due to .conf files being lost.
